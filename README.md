# Currency Debasement Visualization

This interactive visualization shows the dramatic devaluation of currencies against gold since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, when the US dollar's (and by extension, most global currencies') gold backing was removed.

## Key Historical Events

-   **1971**: Nixon ends dollar convertibility to gold, marking the start of the modern fiat currency era
-   **1971-1980**: Gold rises from $35 to $850 as currencies begin their free-fall
-   **1980s-1990s**: Period of relative currency stability but continued debasement
-   **2000-2011**: Gold rises from $300 to $1,900 during the Great Financial Crisis
-   **2020-2024**: Unprecedented money printing during COVID leads to gold reaching new highs above $2,300

## Notable Currency Collapses

The visualization allows you to track how different national currencies have performed against gold since 1971. Some dramatic examples:

-   Japanese Yen: Lost over 95% of its gold value
-   British Pound: Lost over 97% of its gold value
-   US Dollar: Lost over 98% of its gold value

## About the Project

This visualization uses:

-   Historical gold price data from 1833-2024
-   Exchange rate data for major currencies since 1971
-   Interactive map showing relative currency strength against gold
-   Color coding to show which currencies have been debased the most

As Satoshi Nakamoto noted:

> "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust."

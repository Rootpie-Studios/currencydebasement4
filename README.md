# Currency Debasement Visualization

This interactive visualization shows the dramatic devaluation of currencies against gold since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, when the US dollar's (and by extension, most global currencies') gold backing was removed.

> "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust."
